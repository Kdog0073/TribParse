Jarvan IV [00:00:57] Just to let you know, I'm going off tank, not full tank.
Janna [00:01:02] No jungle on their team :x Yak, can you handle 2v1
Jarvan IV [00:01:08] Uhhhhh.
Jarvan IV [00:01:24] For a little while, but I'll need some ganks, as one would assume.
Graves [00:01:32] if anything just play defensive and don't give kill :P
Jarvan IV [00:01:41] Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Jarvan IV [00:01:59] But still. I'm on my off-tank setup, it's easier to just get ganks and kill them than always defend.
Janna [00:02:07] :<
